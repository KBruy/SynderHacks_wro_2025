PRODUCT TO ANALYZE (OUR SHOPIFY STORE):

AVAILABLE PRODUCTS IN OUR SHOPIFY STORE (with stock > 0):
{shop_products_text if shop_products_text else "No other products currently in stock"}

MARKET DATA FOR ANALYSIS (DummyJSON - for comparison only, NOT our products):
{json.dumps(market_data[:5], indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}

TASK:
Generate maximum 2-3 suggestions for product ID {product['id']}:
1. Price optimization (price) - compare with market prices
2. Promotion (promo) - combine with ANOTHER product from our store (provide its ID) - ONLY if other products are available
3. Bundle (bundle) - combine 2-3 products from our store (provide their IDs) - ONLY if other products are available

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:
- ALL suggestions concern ONLY products from our Shopify store!
- In bundle/promo use ONLY IDs from "AVAILABLE PRODUCTS IN OUR SHOPIFY STORE" section
- ONLY use products that have stock > 0 (all listed products have stock available)
- DO NOT use products from DummyJSON - that's only for market analysis!
- Bundle must contain 2-3 products from our store (provide specific IDs)
- Promo can combine 2 products (1+1, provide specific IDs)
- If no other products are available, only suggest price optimization
- Write ALL descriptions and reasoning in ENGLISH language!

Respond ONLY in JSON format (all text in English):
{{
  "suggestions": [
    {{
      "type": "price|promo|bundle",
